## Overview

I've been doing this work just to remind me of some studies i'm working on. It was nice to do this job, although I had problem to align the DIV, and that's why it's good to remember the basics.

## My process

    It wasn't hard to put all together, i had problems to align the main DIV, because I'm still learning about positions using CSS. 
    This project was totally about CSS.
